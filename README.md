# GSP-Algorithm
Sequential Pattern Mining using the GSP Algorithm
Objective:
To implement and apply the Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP) Algorithm for mining frequent
sequential patterns from a dataset.
Task 1: Implement and Apply the GSP Algorithm
Steps:
1. Choose a Dataset:
○ Select a dataset that contains sequential data, such as customer transactions,
website clickstreams, or medical event logs.

2. Preprocessing:
○ Convert the dataset into a format suitable for the GSP algorithm.
○ Convert sequential events into transactions.
○ Transform data into a binary format if necessary (e.g., 1 if an item was purchased,
0 otherwise).

3. Implementation of GSP Algorithm:
○ Implement the GSP algorithm using a programming language of your choice (e.g.,
Python).
○ Use a function to compute the support of sequences.
○ Generate frequent sequences by iterating over the dataset and applying the
minimum support threshold.

4. Parameter Tuning:
○ Train the GSP algorithm on the dataset.
○ Adjust parameters such as minimum support and sequence length.
○ Identify and extract meaningful patterns.
5. Pattern Analysis & Interpretation:
○ Analyze the discovered patterns to derive insights.
○ Utilize visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to represent patterns.
6. Performance Evaluation:
○ Measure execution time and memory usage on different dataset sizes.
